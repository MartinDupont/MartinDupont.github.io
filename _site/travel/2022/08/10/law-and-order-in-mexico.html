  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For three months in 2021 I visited a little seaside town in Mexico named Playa del Carmen. It is an hour south of Cancun, the famous holiday spot. Whereas Cancun is full of big hotels and caters to rich American families, Playa del Carmen is where young, single people go to party. During the particularly harsh lockdowns in Germany, where I was living at the time, I had heard rumours that Mexico was one of the only countries that didn’t currently have any quarantine restrictions on entry. Apparently all the young people who were sick of lockdowns had gone there to live until all of this blew over. After being locked in my house for months on end, which had led to a personal crisis for me, I made a rather spontaneous decision to take a year off my job and holiday, and Playa del Carmen was my first stop.</p>

<p>When you first arrive there, one of the first things that you notice is the absolute omnipresence of the police. They cruise around in converted pickup trucks, with space for six policemen to ride in the back. Teams of two riding on quadbikes are also a common sight. They are almost always armed with some sort of semiautomatic rifle. The nighttime streets are continuously lit by the flashing of red and blue lights.</p>

<p>These policemen don’t appear to do very much however, during daylight hours at least. In fact, if you can avoid interfering with the cartels, Playa del Carmen is much safer than you may have been led to believe. There is an abundance of petty crime, such as phones and purses being snatched, and break-ins are quite frequent, and even once someone attempted to drug me in the club. But there are very few risks to your life. Tourists don’t get robbed at knifepoint or kidnapped. Most of the crime there comes from poor people simply trying to scrape some money together.</p>

<p>Despite the abundance of petty crime, the police don’t ever make much of an effort to catch these criminals, and chasing down burglars doesn’t require a deployment of police that closely resembles a military occupation.</p>

<p>They are of course there to keep the cartels in check. If the police were absent, the cartels would run this town, yet still, neither side actually wants to start a conflict. Particularly from the side of the cartels. Violence drives away tourists, who are there to buy the drugs that make the town valuable to the cartels in the first place. The result of this is that the police are cruising around relatively unoccupied most of the day. It would surprise few to learn that they are <a href="https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexicos-state-police-low-pay-limited-benefits/">poorly paid</a> and <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/brief/mexico-police-are-overworked-underpaid-and-poorly-distributed-report/">overworked</a>. This means that after dark they get up to some mischief.</p>

<p>Before I went to visit to Playa del Carmen, I was worried about getting robbed at knifepoint on the street by a burglar. After talking with some people who live here it became quickly apparent that the police are the people you need to be worried about. They mostly tend to target drunk tourists who are walking home on their own. They perform a search for drugs, during which they will open your wallet, and surreptitiously or sometimes just overtly take out your money.</p>

<p>This happened to me once, I decided to take the risk of walking home one night, and of course a pickup full of six policemen flags me down. I lamented that I had literally already just been searched, to no avail. One policeman conducts the search, asks me some basic questions in Spanish, and his colleagues laugh and jeer at me when I don’t understand. This is sport for them. Now, the crucial thing is, I was fairly sober, and noticing this, the policeman takes the cash out of my wallet and hands it to me, then searches the wallet. He gives me my wallet back, after toying with me for a bit longer. After the whole thing is said and done and the police have driven away, I take a look in my wallet and there is indeed still cash in there, it’s just lighter.</p>

<p>If the police are feeling bolder, they will skip any pretence of law enforcement and proceed directly to trying to extract a bribe out of you via intimidation. This happened to a girl I met who had been living there for some time. She was sitting on the park bench, and there was by chance an empty beer can next to her. The cops roll up, tell her that she’s been caught drinking in public, drag her into the back of their van, and drive her around town and threaten her with charges unless she pays a bribe. But, if you’re a girl, and you cry on demand, you can normally get out of the situation pretty easily, as she did.</p>

<p>One time, I was again foolishly walking home along the main boulevard late at night unescorted, I cross a police truck at the intersection trying to pull turn onto the main road. They wave me past, and I was reassured that they didn’t want to search me, as I was and appeared fairly sober. But, they then quickly turn onto the street and drive in front of me. The passenger side door opens and the officer stumbles out of the truck. With droopy eyes he mumbles “something something substancias illicitas”. He is asking me if I have any illicit substances on me, while being clearly very drunk. I was rather taken aback by this but I handed him my wallet and stayed calm. His colleague also stepped out of the truck, and seemed completely unperturbed by what was happening. The drunken officer searched me, and meanwhile his colleague played along by trying to intimidate me. He asks where my mask was (there was nominally a mask mandate in place), and acts like I was in big trouble because I wasn’t wearing it. Thankfully, the drunken officer doesn’t manage to find anything that he can use to bribe me, and they get back in the trunk and leave me be.</p>

<p>The more interesting situation is when they actually find drugs on you. This happened to a friend of mine. He had a particularly bad night at a place called hostel 3b, where he bought something off the bouncer that was nominally cocaine but was cut with something that messed him right up. He was having a rather bad time, and so decided to call it a night and head home. The hostel was only two blocks from his house, so he felt safe walking. Alas, no, the policemen drove by and noticed that he was walking rather slowly, so they pulled over and told him that they’re searching him for drugs. Which they of course find. This is when the game starts. They say “oooh this is very very bad. Es problema. Arrest Arrest”. They asked him “porque tienes tu estas?” (why do you have this?) to which he replied “para la fiesta …. “ (for the party). His honesty seemed to surprise the officers. I don’t think they expected an answer, but rather intended to intimidate as a schoolteacher would. The two of them play a bad cop bad cop routine, where one of them types things into google translate so he can threaten you in english, while the other will make small gestures to put you off guard, such as twirling the handcuffs, taking photos of you, taking photos of your Id and frequently interjecting with “es problema” (it’s a problem). The intimidation tactics didn’t really work on my friend though simply because he was too tired to give a shit. He told them that this “problema” of theirs has a solution.</p>

<p>One cop tried to tell him that the fine is $500 USD, to which he simply replied “no”. He is quite proud of this. The policeman said “too much? No tienes?” (You don’t have it?), to which my friend replied “no tengo, no quiero”. $500 US is possibly more than the average monthly wage in Mexico and so is clearly not the real price of the fine. After seeing that he’s not that gullible, the policeman tells him that the fine down at the station is 7000 pesos (350US). To which he replied “you two get 5000 Pesos, right now”. They mull it over, and accept. They then escorted him to an ATM where he pulled out the required funds.</p>

<p>The strangest thing about the whole experience was that after he gave them the bribe/fine, they gave him cocaine back, followed by a short speech about there being a curfew in effect and they go on their way. It was as if the little speech helped them at least pretend that they were being real policemen. But, the fact that they gave him his drugs back illustrates that this whole escapade isn’t about drug enforcement at all, it’s simply about extracting bribes from drunk tourists. If they wanted to crack down on drugs they could simply have an undercover officer walk down the main boulevard, take note of everybody who offers him drugs, then let some officers cruise through an hour later and arrest every single one of them. But of course that would anger the cartel. This is what happens when you have an overstaffed underpaid police force who are unable to do anything about real crime.</p>

<p>The nature of law and order in mexico is also quite starkly illustrated by the citizens response to the coronavirus restrictions. After an initial lockdown, which from what people told me was actually observed, people mostly stopped caring and only went along with the simplest of formalities.</p>

<p>I had sought out Playa del Carmen as a place to visit specifically because of the lasseiz faire covid restrictions. Unfortunately, only a few weeks after I got there, cases started to rise again, and the government put an 11pm curfew in place. I had previously been living in Germany, and the German obedience to authority must have rubbed off on me because I simply followed the rules and went home at 11pm, because I thought there was nothing to do. After two weeks I realised that of course, in Mexico, people don’t take rules too seriously, and many clubs had found ways around the restrictions.</p>

<p>The easiest way to avoid closing is to be run by the cartel. This was the case for hostel 3b, which was a rooftop bar and so it was quite transparently still open, and the music was clearly audible from street level. The policemen of course drove right past it every night and turned a blind eye. Though they were more than happy to stop and search the patrons leaving the club, who had almost certainly bought something off the club bouncer and were thus prime targets for the police.</p>

<p>The other way to stay open is to simply bribe the police. In Mexico, essentially any rule can be broken with a large enough bribe. This is what my favourite club “Santino” did. The club has a rooftop section, but no windows, so past 11pm they would shut the front door, and shut the rooftop section, and keep the party going inside. Whenever a police cruiser rolled around, they turned the music down and the DJ had to yell over the microphone for everyone to stay quiet. It was all rather amusing actually, like misbehaving children hiding from the teacher. I found out that the police were actually just being bribed by the club owners. So they knew that the place was still open, but it is important to maintain the appearance that the rules are being followed.</p>

<p>This strategy isn’t foolproof, as some clubs still got raided. This happened at a speakeasy club one evening. They were either too loud or didn’t bribe the right people, so the police showed up, shut the party down, and held up the patrons trying to leave for hours by insisting on searching everybody for drugs, which, of course, many of them had.</p>

<p>As with all Covid restrictions, the curfew led to some distortions. Namely clubs that had an open layout and were accessible from street level could not plausibly pretend to be closed. So they simply had to lose money hand over fist for months on end.
Bribery is so common there that it is absolutely casual. You have a house party in a gated community that gets a bit out of control? Bribe the security guard. You want to go to a swimming hole on private property? Bribe the security guard. The club is full and you still want to get in? Bribe the security guard. Many of my friends there actually enjoyed that aspect of it, because if you’re an ordinary gringo earning 5x as much as the locals, you can essentially do whatever you feel like.</p>

<p>So, we see in a microcosm what law enforcement in Mexico is about. The policemen need to appear as if they are doing their jobs, and the people need to appear as if they are following the rules. Any time you get caught, there is a price you can pay to make the problem disappear. Meanwhile this huge, well-armed police force is unable to tackle the greatest criminal scourge on the country, and seem relatively uninterested in solving petty crimes, and thus spend their days driving around simply being visible. But at the end of the day, crime still occurs, and the police aren’t enforcing the law.</p>
